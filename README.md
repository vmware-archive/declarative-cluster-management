# Declarative Cluster Management

## Overview

A tool that enables programmers to specify cluster management policies in a
high-level declarative language, and compute policy-compliant configurations
automatically and efficiently. DCM allows constraints and policies, the
essence of a cluster manager, to be easily added, removed and modified
over time, using a language familiar to developers (SQL).

## Try it out

### Pre-requisites

We currently support only the MiniZinc solver backend. You can download it from: minizinc.org.

Make sure you are able to invoke the `minizinc` binary from your commandline.


### Building

 $: mvn package
